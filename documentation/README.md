## 🔧 System Overview

The CCI Hackathon 2025 Backend is a comprehensive food management and recipe recommendation system with the following key features:

### Core Functionality
- **Receipt Processing**: AI-powered image analysis and data extraction
- **Recipe Generation**: Personalized recipe recommendations based on available ingredients
- **User Management**: Profile and dietary preference management
- **Ingredient Tracking**: Inventory management with expiry tracking

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI Services**: Perplexity AI, KronosLabs
- **Server**: Uvicorn (ASGI)

### Key Components
- **API Gateway**: FastAPI application with CORS and middleware
- **Route Handlers**: Receipt, recipe, and user management endpoints
- **Business Logic**: Image processing, recipe generation, data standardization
- **Data Access**: MongoDB integration with connection pooling
- **External Services**: AI service integration for receipt and recipe processing

## 📊 API Endpoints Summary

| Category | Endpoints | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **General** | `GET /`, `GET /health` | Welcome message and health check |
| **Users** | `POST /users/`, `GET /users/{user}` | User profile management |
| **Receipts** | `POST /receipts/` | Receipt image processing |
| **Recipes** | `GET /recipes/{user}`, `POST /recipes/ingredients/`, `GET /recipes/ingredients/{user}` | Recipe generation and ingredient management |

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Clone repository and setup virtual environment
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Configure environment variables in `.env`
4. Start development server with `python main.py`
5. Access API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Testing
- Unit tests: `pytest tests/`
- API tests: Use TestClient for endpoint testing
- Integration tests: Test with real MongoDB and AI services

### Code Quality
- Code formatting: Black formatter
- Linting: Flake8
- Type checking: MyPy
- Pre-commit hooks: Automated quality checks

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Development
- Local Python environment
- Docker container
- Docker Compose with MongoDB

### Production
- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Serverless deployment (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run)
- Traditional VPS deployment

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### API Security
- Input validation with Pydantic models
- File upload validation and size limits
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Environment variable protection

### Data Security
- MongoDB connection security
- API key management
- Sensitive data encryption
- Access control and authentication (future enhancement)

## 📈 Performance and Scalability

### Performance Optimization
